amino acid index database
every amino acid has its own proteins - some are small, some are large

can convert amigo acids into numbers
take average of all numbers in a sequence
give you an average property of the entire sequence
approximation of the size of the whole protein

removing X's can change what type of protein it is

delete x, computer features without it
then count how many sequences had 8

21 features is really not nearly enough

we can combine features from other sources
just make sure that the we maintain the sequence order

corresponding feature sets match with each feature

software A and B may compute similar features and thus overlap
	this is okay but it may be more computationally expensive

maybe eliminate similar features
get more features but don't overfit

number of features should be at least an order of magnitude smaller than dataset

hundreds are okay, thousands are not

r package
features from sequences

SMOTE RNDNA?
Half the rest?

remove X and Z
